    <p>I am a passionate developer who loves blending creativity with logic to
      build meaningful digital experiences.
      Web design is where my journey began, and it continues to drive my
      interest in full-stack development, which 
      I am currently learning through a Microsoft-powered Coursera course. I
      enjoy the process of transforming ideas 
      into responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly applications. UI/UX
      design excites me because I believe 
      great design should feel natural, simple, and purposeful.

      I enjoy solving complex problems and breaking them down into clean,
      efficient solutions. I thrive in team environments, 
      value collaboration, and believe that teamwork creates stronger and more
      innovative results. Punctuality, responsibility,
      and attention to detail are core values I bring to every project. I am a
      strong believer in self-learning and continuous
      improvement, always exploring new technologies, experimenting with
      designs, and refining my skills through real-world practice.

      Outside the world of code, football is my biggest passion. I love playing
      and watching the game and proudly support Liverpool FC.
      Watching Chelsea vs Liverpool live at Anfield was an unforgettable moment
      that continues to inspire my love for the sport. Music,
      especially rap, keeps me motivated and creative. I also enjoy exploring
      nature and historical places, which helps me recharge,
      stay curious, and find inspiration beyond the screen.
